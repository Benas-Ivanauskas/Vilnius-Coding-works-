Here you can find all the projects and homework tasks I completed during my time at Vilnius Coding School. I utilized CSS and the CSS Bootstrap framework for these assignments. Please ensure you have the correct version of Bootstrap installed for optimal viewing.

Make sure you are using these Bootsrap versions:

    <script
